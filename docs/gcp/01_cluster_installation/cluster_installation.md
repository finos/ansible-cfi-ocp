# OpenShift Compliant Financial Infrastructure

## GC Project setup and Cluster Installation 

The OpenShift (OCP) Installer supports two installation methods, Installer Provisioned Infrastructure(IPI) and User Provisioned Infrastructure(UPI). IPI is an opinionated automated installation, this is the installation method that will be used. UPI gives users more flexibility to install OCP on pre-provisioned infrastructure, for example an on-premises installation where a firm's IT standards and policies prevent the use of an opinionated and automated installation. More details on OpenShift Installation can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/index.html).

It is possile for OCP to be installed into a disconnected / air-gapped environment or be configured to have no public endpoints. To meet the current service accelerator requirements this is not required, the following instructions will implement a cluster that is internet connected and has public end-points. 

The following provides an overview of the steps needed to install OCP on GC, to meet the requirements of the service accelerator, customisation needs to be made both at install time and as a day two change. To make the changes at install time we will use the [Installing a Cluster on GCP with Customisations](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html) installation method.

Following, are the high level steps to complete OCP installation, including the service accelerator polices to implement [FIPS cryptography](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing-fips.html) and [OVNKubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.html#about-ovn-kubernetes). It is planned that in the future, code will be added to this CFI project to automate these steps. 

1. Setup the [GCP project](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html) ready for the OCP installation. This includes:
    - Creating the GC project Folder
    - Enabling the API's that the OCP Installer requires
    - Create a DNS public zone
    - Increasing GC quotas (if needed).
    - Creating a GC service account for the OCP Installer and give it the required permissions
    - [download the OCP installer and service account key](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html) onto a local machine or a bastion where the installer is run and the installer state files can be stored.   

3. Create the [installation configuration file](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html#installation-initializing_installing-gcp-customizations)

    - Run the OCP installer to create the *install-config* file that will be used to implement install time customisations. Here is an example command: 

```shell
./openshift-install create install-config --dir=/Users/*home*/ocp_clusters/<cluster_name>
```
  - Edit the install-config YAML file to implement FIPS and OVNKubernetes, here is an example [config yaml](install-config.yaml) 
  - Run the OCP installer to create the cluster. Here is an example command

```shell
./openshift-install create cluster --dir=/Users/*home*/ocp_clusters/<cluster_name> --log-level debug
```

Once the cluster installation completes, which normally takes 30-40 minutes, the installer output includes the OCP console url, kubeadmin userid and password and KUBECONFIG. 

To access the cluster via a system:admin user use the following command:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=/Users/*home*/ocp_clusters/<cluster_name>/auth/kubeconfig
```


FIPS compliance is managed via the OpenShift Compliance Operator, which will be discussed later. To confirm that the OVNKubernetes SDN has been implemented log into the cluster and run the following commands.

```shell
oc describe network.config/cluster
``` 

Check the output for 'Network Type:  OVNKubernetes'

```bash
Status:
  Cluster Network:
    Cidr:               10.128.0.0/14
    Host Prefix:        23
  Cluster Network MTU:  1360
  Network Type:         OVNKubernetes
  Service Network:
    172.30.0.0/16
```

The next step of the installation process is to set up an identity provider. An example using [HTPASSWD](../02_htpasswd_identity_provider/htpasswd_implementation.md) has been provided. OCP supports a number of identity providers, more detail can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html)
